# Data Handling

## Activity
For Task 1, we cleaned and explored the data to find correlations between potability and other features. We used heatmaps and scatter plots to visualise the correlations.

## Findings
We found that there was little to no correlation between the different features and the data. This led us to conclude that perhaps individual features do not contribute to the data, but rather, combinations of features(super-features). Therefore, we decided to implement a deep neural network in the steps that followed.
